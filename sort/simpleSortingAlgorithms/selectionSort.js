// The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

// Selection sort pseudocode
// Store the first element index as the smallest value youâ€™ve seen so far.
// Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
// If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new minimum and continue until the end of the array.
// If the minimum is not the value you initially began with, swap the two values.
// Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
